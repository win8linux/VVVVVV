VVVVVV's source code is made available under a [custom license](LICENSE.md), which states that you must not distribute any materials from the game (i.e. the game's assets) which are not included in this repo unless approved by us in writing. The following is a list of projects which have been given permission by Terry, and under what conditions.

| Project | Creator | Description | Conditions | Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cursed_VVVVVV | MustardBucket | Modified version of VVVVVV where instead of flipping gravity you jump normally, can jump multiple times, and wall jump. | https://twitter.com/terrycavanagh/status/1216447162634186762 |https://twitter.com/mustard_bucket/status/1216272971779670016 |

In general, if you're interested in creating something that falls outside the license terms, [get in touch with Terry!](http://distractionware.com/email/)
